# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Intelligent Adaptive Trading Bot

**Version:** 1.1 - Battle-Tested Edition  
**Last Updated:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** Updated with Production Requirements

---

## ðŸš¨ Critical Updates (v1.1)

Based on production trading system experience, the following MANDATORY improvements have been added:

### Must-Have Before Live Trading:
1. **Server-Side Stops**: Every position must have reduce-only stop on exchange (survives bot crashes)
2. **Idempotent Orders**: All orders use `client_order_id` to prevent duplicates on retry
3. **Reconciliation Service**: Independent service verifying local state matches exchange every 10-30s
4. **PostgreSQL Database**: SQLite insufficient for concurrent writes and crash recovery
5. **NTP Time Sync**: All times in UTC, NTP configured, exchange time deltas logged
6. **Volatility Targeting**: Position sizing scaled by asset volatility (smoother returns)

### Quick Wins (Implement in Week 1):
- Add `client_order_id` to all order submissions
- Install server-side stops immediately after fills
- Configure NTP and enforce UTC timestamps
- Set up WAL mode if using SQLite (Phase 1 only)

---
